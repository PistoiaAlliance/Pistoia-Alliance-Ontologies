The IDMP Ontology (IDMP-O) 1.2 release, the first public release of the ontology, consists of an abridged, combined version of a number of the project ontologies. It covers aspects of (1) ISO-21090 - Health informatics - Harmonized data types for information interchange, (2) ISO-11240 - Health informatics - Identification of medicinal products - Data elements and structures for the unique identification and exchange of units of measurement, (3) ISO-11238 - Health informatics - Identification of medicinal products - Data elements and structures for the unique identification and exchange of regulated information on substances, and (4) ISO-11615 - Health informatics - Identification of medicinal products - Data elements and structures for the unique identification and exchange of regulated medicinal product information, as required to support the use cases identified by project stakeholders to date. This release focused primarily on bug fixing, usability, and simplification, in preparation for upcoming extensions supporting additional use cases in the IDMP-O 1.3 revision. Analysis done over several weeks led to the conclusion that certain constructs, including some related to packaging, could be simplified for ease of use as well as to increase representation and reasoning efficiency. New work in the next version will incorporate concepts needed for use cases such as EMA PMS Data Alignment PoC, filling in gaps where there are missing attributes, for example, for some parts of the model.

The merged ontology includes content from four individual ontologies that comprise the IDMP-O release, simplified and combined for ease of public use, and that extend or reference the following:
   - Dublin Core Metadata Terms - http://purl.org/dc/terms/ (referenced, not imported)
   - Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) - http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core# (referenced, not imported)
   - Commons Ontology Library from the Object Management Group (OMG) - https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/ (imported, 18 ontologies from the library)

Note that these ontologies are not included in the uploaded, combined IDMP-O ontology, but rather can be found by 'following your nose'.
